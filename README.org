* What is this?
  This is library to implement particle methods based algorithms. This is highly
  inspired from [[https://github.com/pypr/pysph][pysph]] ( I would say clone). Particle methods like

  - Discrete element method.
  - Smoothed particle hydrodynamics

  will be implemented


* How to run
  First make sure you have rust installed. You can find the instructions at [[https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/][here]].
  To run an [[https://github.com/dineshadepu/prestige/blob/master/examples/dam_break_dem.rs][example]], clone the repository.

  #+NAME: name
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/dineshadepu/prestige
cd prestige
  #+END_SRC

  Then run the example by
  #+NAME: name
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo run --example dam_break_dem
  #+END_SRC

  This will generate output (=vtk= files) in =dam_break_dem_output= folder. By
  using paraview we can visualize the particles.
